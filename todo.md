Improve magnetic

- Fix magnetic items keeping on active state
- improve sticky button to do not rely on a padding and consider the cursor outer
- Magnetic to animate out only when the intersection between the icon and the round circle ends. This way I don't need the mouseleave listener. For that I need to understand better the intersection API

- Understand why sometimes minutes and seconds are stickying together (very odd bug probably going to leave like this)
