# FEATURES I REALLY WANT

recreate scroll triggers from recommendations and competences when text change. Maybe the footer should work better doing the sames

Check if scss is being cleaned up

Add some message if payload takes to much time to run

change lang logic to be a pathÂ /pt-BR so all routes can be generated properly without needing to go to backend

change main deploy to nuxtHub
|--change cloudinary images to nuxtHub

# FEATURES FOR LATER

- understand how can I properly set posthog api key to only accept requests from specific hosts

add music section and login once appwrite allow transactions

- https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/issues/2788
- https://appwrite.io/threads/1096798213350109184
- remember that cloudflare proxy might affect the url in staging if it's not working

Improve magnetic

- Fix magnetic items keeping on active state
- improve sticky button to do not rely on a padding and consider the cursor outer
- Magnetic to animate out only when the intersection between the icon and the round circle ends. This way I don't need the mouseleave listener. For that I need to understand better the intersection API

- Understand why sometimes minutes and seconds are stickying together (very odd bug probably going to leave like this)

- better SEO https://nuxtseo.com/nuxt-seo/getting-started/installation

- Limit IP's that can call Payload CMS
