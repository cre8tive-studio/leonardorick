this can be done on the webhook by saving more information

implement incrementAvailableSongs on both stripe webhook and on user creation
create visualisation of songs only for users that are logged in
test everything related to the user creation

implement logic that allows user to like songs
each month the user gains 2 upvotes that he can expend on the songs
the user can see the total upvotes of a song and how many times he upvoted
the user can remove upvotes from one song and add to another that he is seeing
