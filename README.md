## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
npm run dev
```

Make sure to check .env.example to check the necessary variables needed to run the probject.

### Note

This project is my experimental playground where I try out different things, so the structure and coding may not be as organized as you would expect in a real project. In real life, we don't usually use so many different animations and tend to repeat things more. But here, I went all out and did everything I've always wanted to do!

The main focus here is on three things: 1) the amount of maintenance required in the code (this project is not meant to be constantly changed), 2) the number of developers working on the code (just me), and 3) concentrating on what truly matters (perfectionism isn't always necessary).

If you're interested in checking out some well-structured code, take a look at my github and the [js-libs](https://github.com/LeonardoRick/js-libs) project where I create helper functions for my projects.
